XChat-Translator
================
A translator for xchat using Google Translate via YQL.

This script is based on the script by Young Ng.  The original script can be found at:

	http://code.google.com/p/gtranslatecmd/downloads/detail?name=translator.py

By default, the script translates everything to English (en) unless otherwise specified.  This can be changed by changing the language code for DEFAULT_LANG on line 16.

COMMANDS
========
/TR target_language message - translates message into the language specified.  This auto detects the source language.  This is not threaded.

/TM source_language target_language message - translates message into the language specified.  This is not threaded.

/ADDTR user_nick target_language source_language - adds the user to the watch list for automatic translations.  If target_language is not specified, then the DEFAULT_LANG value will be used.  If source_language is not specified, then language detection will be used.

/RMTR user_nick - removes user_nick from the watch list for automatic translations.

/LSUSERS - prints out all users on the watch list for automatic translations to the screen locally.

/LASTERROR - prints out the last error message to screen locally.
